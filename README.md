# Calculator

This is a simple command-line calculator that takes user input for two numbers and performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
Later we integrated a web-server running on port 3000 which delivers the command-line calculator on a browser experience.

## Scope
AI testing and Training for Code Development

This code was generated by an AI model trained by Tabnine, a popular AI-assisted code editor. The model was trained on a large corpus of open-source code and programming tutorials, and is capable of generating code and text in a variety of programming languages and formats.

While the code is not perfect, it represents the latest innovations in natural language processing and machine learning, and demonstrates the potential of AI to automate the production of code and text.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tHeStRyNg/calculator.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd calculator`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the calculator: `node calculator.js`

## Usage

To use the calculator, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command to start the server: `node calculator.js`
3. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the calculator interface.
4. Enter two numbers and select an operation from the dropdown menu.
5. Click the "Calculate" button to see the result.
